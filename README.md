#PentasphereTracker

###What is it?
The PentasphereTracker is a simple program written in C# that tries
to logically map a 3D object's travel path through a 5D sphere.

###How is it?
When given the radius for a sphere, I calculate the density, as
well as the gravitational pull of the sphere itself. I then use
those to map the sphere into polar coordinates for each axis of
travel that is available.

###Why is it?
My roommate and I were asked to do a D&D campaign by a group of
friends, and I had been planning on a penteract dungeon. He thought
"Why not just use a sphere?" And here we are.

####Misc Information
As this project develops, I will be adding more and more features.
While this version is only a **PROOF OF CONCEPT**, the model used
is, as far as we've thought out, as correct as possible.

Yeet.
